# buildOn Schoolhouse Sherpas - Trek
**Basanta, Nepal** *(January 4 - 10, 2025)*

*By Parth Chandak and Richa Jatia*

Our buildOn journey began more than a year before our trek in January 2025. 

*Richa*: When I first met Morgan Dickerson, the Community Engagement Manager at buildOn, and she told me about Trek, I knew immediately that I wanted to put together a team. Education has always been close to my heart, and this was a unique opportunity to bring together friends, colleagues, and even strangers to fundraise for building a school. The idea of not only raising funds but also living in the community to help lay the school’s foundation was incredibly powerful - a tangible way to bring the impact of our efforts to life.

*Parth*: When Richa approached me about Trek, I was instantly drawn to the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in a small community through education. I said yes without hesitation, and it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made.

We initially put together a team of 15 and chose Nepal as our destination because of its deep cultural ties to our home country, India. Our team name, Schoolhouse Sherpas, was a tribute to the Sherpas of Nepal, who tirelessly support climbers in their mountaineering journeys. Similarly, our mission was to be Sherpas for this school - to support the community in building it. This wouldn’t be our victory but theirs; we were simply there to help them achieve their dream.

Thus began our nearly year-long journey to raise $55,000 for the school and our trek fees. From organizing guest bartending events to hosting a pickleball tournament with 52 players, the experience was nothing short of an adventure. It was humbling to witness the generosity of so many people - those who donated, volunteered their time, or simply cheered us on. By the time we embarked on the trek, our team had evolved: while some were there from the start, others joined later, and a few who helped fundraise couldn’t make it to Nepal. Ultimately, the 11 of us who made the journey were a mix of old and new faces, united by a shared belief in the power of education and a desire to do something bigger than ourselves. Here's a look at our journey to Nepal, through both our eyes.

## **Day 1: Arrival in Kathmandu**

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%;">

</div>
<p class="image-caption">First glimpse of Nepal as we descended into Kathmandu</p>

*Parth*: When our plane landed in Kathmandu, I felt at home in the familiar busy city life that reminded me of Mumbai. Our Trek Leader Santosh Mahato met us at the airport and took us to our hotel. He made sure we had everything we needed, including hot water. His attentiveness signaled the start of what would be an expertly guided journey. 

*Richa*: Strangely enough, Kathmandu reminded me of Kabul - a city I’ve never been to before. Its short, cramped buildings, bustling streets, and markets overflowing with souvenirs felt like echoes of the Kabul I’d imagined while reading books like *The Kite Runner*. Meeting the entire team in person was really exciting - many of whom had only been faces on Zoom until then. That night, we went to bed early, eager to begin our journey to Dhangadi, the district near the town of Basanta where we’d be building the school.

## **Day 2: Dhangadi and the school visit**

In the morning we had breakfast with the rest of our team. After a delayed journey to Dhangadi, thanks to the infamous winter fog (it seems even oceans away, we San Franciscans couldn’t escape Karl the Fog), we spent the afternoon visiting a completed buildOn school nearby. 

This visit filled our hearts with hope. The children gave us such a warm welcome - they put flower garlands around our necks and shared their songs and dances with us. Their joy was catching, and soon we were all smiling.

</div>
<p class="image-caption">School children sharing their culture through dance and song</p>

*Parth*: One of the most impactful moments came during our introduction to buildOn's adult literacy program. Through our skilled translators, Madan and Runam, we heard powerful testimonials from villagers whose lives had been transformed. They spoke of "new life" of learning basic economics and mathematics, of starting their own handicraft and farming businesses.

*Richa*: What stood out to me was that most of the adults in this program were women. In countries like India and Nepal, rural women often don’t have the confidence to step outside traditional roles or access opportunities to learn. Yet here they were, showing incredible initiative and courage by coming to school every day - not only to manage household or agricultural work more effectively, but to help their children with homework and ensure they stayed in school. It was deeply moving and a powerful reminder of the ripple effect education can create.

The joy and gratitude of the school children touched our hearts deeply. They had prepared special performances to thank us - their small faces beaming with excitement as they danced and sang traditional songs. Their enthusiasm was contagious, and we found ourselves clapping along, caught up in their happiness. It was a beautiful demonstration of how a school can become the heart of a community, nurturing not just education but also cultural pride and creativity.

Later that night, we were introduced to the dedicated buildOn management team, including Trek Coordinator, Ardahana (Anu) Chaudhary, and Deputy Trek Director, Jharana Bam. Learning that this would be buildOn's 419th school in Nepal, and that some team members had participated in over 100 treks, gave us a sense of the program's incredible scale and impact.

## **Day 3: Journey to Basanta**

*Parth*: The morning began early as we boarded our team bus to Basanta. What awaited us was a welcome ceremony that would stay with me forever. The entire village had lined up to greet us, creating a human pathway to the school playground, which had been beautifully decorated for our arrival.

</div>
<p class="image-caption">The village's warm welcome ceremony</p>

*Richa*: For me, it was the excitement. The women, dressed in their beautiful traditional attire, were laughing, dancing, and singing all around us. A group of them pulled the women in our team in and began dancing with us, their joy infectious. They even wrapped lehengas around our waists, making us feel like we weren’t just guests but an integral part of their community and celebration. As I sat at the ceremony, a group of young girls, aged six to ten, gathered around me and my friend. We began chatting with them, using the few sentences of Nepali we had learned that morning and Hindi, which most of them understood a little. There was Sonya, who sat on my lap, her smile never fading. Then there was Radha, the older sister who eagerly shared stories about her favorite subject at school and what she enjoyed doing in her free time. Another girl, Subi, lingered quietly in the background at first, but as our neighbor, she quickly grew to be one of the closest to my heart. It was the children in Nepal who would make my trip truly unforgettable.

*Parth*: The day was filled with significant moments – traditional dances, the signing of the covenant (a powerful symbol of community partnership), and a pooja (prayer) to mark the beginning of the project. But perhaps the most meaningful moment was meeting my host father, Mr. Tulasiram Tharu. 

Mr. Tharu's hospitality began immediately as he loaded our bags onto his bicycle. At his home, I met his warm family - his daughter-in-law who managed the household with grace and his cheerful grandson Prince who quickly became my friend. During our walk through the village, we talked with neighbors about their Hindu traditions and their wish to be closer to nearby countries like India. The children couldn't take their eyes off Dean (my teammate who was going to room with me, he is a teacher from Ohio who has taught middle schoolers for 30+ years) for most of them, he was the first American they had ever met. During our walk to his farms, Mr. Tharu shared that his son was working in Malaysia and wouldn't return for three years. Despite the distance, the family's strong bonds were evident in how they supported each other. Communication flowed surprisingly well – my Hindi helped bridge the gap with Nepali, allowing me to translate for my teammate Dean. I learned about the Nepali calendar (Bikram Samvat), discovering that our 2025 was their 2081.

*Richa*: I was staying across the stream from Parth’s home. Instead of a bicycle, I had to hoist my bags on my head - true Indian coolie-style - and walk nearly a mile to my host mother’s house. We were warmly welcomed by her daughter-in-law and her seven-month-old grandson, Ahaan. As we made our way to their home, children from the nearby houses joined us, eager to be part of the moment. Once we settled in, we spent the evening playing games like in-out, musical chairs, and charades. By nightfall, we had formed our own lively little crew, who would become our constant companions over the next few days.

*Parth*: As the sun set, we gathered for our first dinner with the family. The aroma of freshly cooked daal bhat filled the house as we sat cross-legged on the floor. Mr. Tharu's daughter-in-law had prepared a feast - steaming rice, yellow lentil soup, and local vegetable curry. We were surprised to learn that the family only ate two meals a day, which explained the generous portions they served us. The food was incredibly delicious, but we had to politely ask them to reduce our portions - their usual servings were almost twice what we could eat! Prince showed me how to mix everything together with my hands, the traditional way of eating. The simple meal tasted extraordinary, made special by the family's hospitality and the stories we shared despite our language differences.

*Parth*: The evening ended with an impromptu astronomy lesson, as I showed local children how to use a star map app on my phone. Among them was Sagar, a remarkably bright 10th grader whose English skills and intellectual curiosity would continue to impress me throughout our stay.

## **Day 4: Breaking Barriers**

Our days in the community began with yoga at 6AM sharp led by a guru from the buildOn team. Even though it was cold and dark, the exercises warmed us up and got us ready for the day. After breakfast at the main office, we went to the construction site, excited to start the work we had come here to do.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%;">

</div>
<p class="image-caption">Starting our day with morning yoga</p>

We started our first construction day with buildOn's energetic morning cheer, our voices echoing through the village as we prepared to start the digging for the site of the 419th school in Nepal.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%;">

</div>
<p class="image-caption">Our loud cheer</p>

We split into 3 teams. Team One took on the challenging task of digging the foundation trenches. Armed with shovels and pickaxes, we worked in pairs, taking turns to break the hard ground and clear the earth. The physical demands of the work brought us closer together, as we encouraged each other through each scoop of soil.

</div>
<p class="image-caption">Making progress on the foundation work</p>

Team Two focused on preparing the rebar (steel rods) that would reinforce the concrete foundation. This precise work required measuring, cutting, and bending the steel to exact specifications. The local masons showed us their techniques, and we quickly learned that this task needed both strength and accuracy.

</div>
<p class="image-caption">Precision and teamwork in creating the foundation's framework</p>

Team Three was responsible for sifting sand and mixing cement. This was perhaps the most rhythmic work - the steady motion of pushing sand through mesh screens, the methodical mixing of cement with water and aggregate. The villagers taught us their traditional mixing techniques, which required no mechanical equipment but relied on careful attention to consistency and teamwork.

<p class="image-caption">Learning how to sift sand</p>

*Parth*: After an energizing lunch, we participated in a powerful exercise about courage, each of us reflecting on what the word meant to us. But perhaps the most impactful part of the day came during our gender discussion groups. This was a time for the men and the women of our team and the community to share a space and ask each other questions about the other group, a great way to bridge gaps and increase the shared understandings of cultures. The men's group taught me a lot. Most were farmers who wanted to build this school to give their children better chances in life. Growing up in India, I used to hear people joke about village life being "backward," but being here reminded me that my own grandfather came from a village just like this one. The farmers spoke candidly about their challenges: uncertainty about crop yields, concerns about profit margins, and feelings of being trapped. Together, we explored potential solutions like automation and collective farming, drawing parallels with corporate farming practices in the USA.

</div>
<p class="image-caption">Learning from local farmers about their agricultural practices</p>

*Richa*: In the women’s gender group, we shared details about our daily lives and free time. While we spoke about jobs and hobbies, they shared that household chores and agricultural work left them with none. The conversation touched on their dreams for their girls, marriage, menstruation as a taboo, and whether they discussed sexual matters with friends. They also mentioned how women often didn’t support each other when someone wanted to step outside traditional roles, like joining the village council - a challenge that seems universal. It was an honest and vulnerable exchange, offering a rare glimpse into their lives, their challenges, and their resilience

*Parth*: My day ended with an impromptu football match with the village children – a beautiful reminder that play knows no language barriers. As we kicked the ball around under the setting sun, all differences melted away. It wasn't about Americans or Nepalis, buildOn team or villagers – it was simply people connecting through sport.

</div>
<p class="image-caption">Ending the day with a joyful football match with the village children</p>

*Richa*: While Parth bonded through football, Malaika, Yaquta (my trek roomies), and I connected with our girls through dance. They taught us a dance routine to a popular Nepali song, *Rukum Maikot*, and we spent hours laughing and practicing together.

## **Day 5: Building Foundations**


More villagers joined our morning yoga on our second day of building

As we worked harder on the school site, the villagers taught me how to mix cement their way. I could see how their farming skills made them experts with tools - they knew exactly how to use them.

</div>
<p class="image-caption">Learning traditional cement mixing techniques</p>

Some teams formed human chains that snaked across the construction site, passing rocks and pans of sand from one person to another. This method not only made the work faster but brought everyone together - buildOn team members, villagers, and even curious children who wanted to help. The chains became a living symbol of community spirit, with songs and laughter making the heavy loads feel lighter.

But this day held a special surprise – a traditional Nepali wedding ceremony for our teammates, Morgan and Dave. What began as a small celebration transformed into a village-wide festival.

*Parth*: As someone familiar with Indian weddings, I was fascinated by both the similarities and unique aspects of Nepali traditions. I was with Dave at his host family home as they got him ready with his traditional attire. In moments we were dancing and the villagers joined. This slowly became the baraat (the procession from the grooms place to the brides) and in very little time, the whole village started dancing behind Dave as he made his way across the village to meet Morgan.

*Richa:* As I helped Morgan get ready, I was overwhelmed with emotions.

I was so grateful to be a part of this experience, and seeing the joy in the air as we celebrated Morgan and Dave's special day was truly unforgettable.

## **Day 6: Fond Farewells**

*Richa*: Our last morning of construction began with what had become a cherished ritual – yoga at dawn. The number of villagers joining us had grown each day, a beautiful testament to the bonds we'd formed. The crisp morning air was filled with a mix of excitement and nostalgia, knowing this would be our final day of building.

*Parth*: What made this final day even more special was an unexpected surge of young energy. Sagar and his classmates, having spread word about our project to neighboring schools, arrived with their entire 8th, 9th, and 10th grade classes to help with construction. Their presence not only accelerated our work but also symbolized the project's ripple effect throughout the community - these students weren't just building a school, they were building their own future.

The work site buzzed with renewed energy. Looking at our progress from day one to now was nothing short of remarkable. The trenches we'd dug, the foundations we'd laid - each element a physical manifestation of our collective hope for the future.

### The Closing Ceremony

The afternoon transformed into an unforgettable celebration. Our host families presented us with traditional attire, dressing us in local garments that made us feel truly part of their community. The village gathered one final time, the air filled with music and dance.

*Richa*: For me, the celebration was a beautiful showcase of local culture, as village women performed traditional Nepali dances. Their graceful movements and colorful attire created a mesmerizing display of the region's rich cultural heritage.

*Parth*: For me, the ceremony gave way to spontaneous dancing, with Bollywood tunes bringing everyone to their feet. It was a beautiful fusion of cultures – Nepali traditions meeting Indian music, American enthusiasm blending with local grace.

*Richa*: Me and the girls from our team had also prepared a special surprise – we learned a popular Nepali song and choreographed a dance performance.

### Evening of Gratitude

That evening was filled with emotional exchanges of gifts. We presented our host families with items we'd brought from home, while they surprised us with exquisite local handicrafts. Morgan's Polaroid camera proved invaluable, capturing precious moments that we could share – one photo for them, one for us.

*Parth*:My final conversation with Sagar was particularly moving. His bright spirit and technological aptitude had shown me that potential knows no geographical bounds. In him, I saw the future that buildOn was helping to create.

*Richa*:Our team's last gathering stretched from 8 PM until midnight, as we shared our evolving perceptions of each other and the profound ways this experience had changed us. What had begun as a group of strangers had transformed into something far more meaningful – a family united by purpose and experience.

## Day 7: Taking back mmore than just emories

*Parth*:The 3:45 AM alarm came too soon. As we prepared to leave for Dhangadi and then Kathmandu, emotions ran high. The school site we were leaving behind was more than just a construction project – it was a promise to the future, a bridge between cultures, and a testament to what people can achieve together.

The two-hour journey to Dhangadi was followed by some flight delays, but even these couldn't dampen our spirits. Our propeller plane to Kathmandu offered a parting gift – breathtaking views of Mount Everest and the Himalayan range, a majestic farewell to our Nepali adventure.

### Reflections & Special Thanks

The school we helped build in Basanta is more than just bricks and cement. It shows what can happen when people from different places work together. It's a promise of better things to come. We'll never forget what we saw and learned here.

This journey would not have been possible without our incredible team of Schoolhouse Sherpas: David Sang, Morgan Dickerson, Dhruv Baijal, Suchi Jatia, Bree Cave, Jeff Nasser, Esha Desai, Tanu Rathi, Niti Parekh, Malaika Vesavevala, Karim Khairaz, Akhil Shukla and Nikhil Agarwal. Each member brought their unique strengths and perspectives, making our team truly special. Together, we not only reached our fundraising goal but also created lasting bonds with each other and the community of Basanta.
